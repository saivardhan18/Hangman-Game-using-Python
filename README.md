# Hangman-Game-using-Python
Hangman is a guessing game in which the objective of the player is to find out the hidden word. Every incorrect guess leads to the decrement of the chances left for the player. The chances left are represented in the form of a hanging man. And the job of every hero is to save lives. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words with the help of random module. The Game: Here, a random word (a character name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
